Getting started
---------------

Create a virtual environment, within which, install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: By default, this will install JAX to use the CPU. If you want to run JAX
on a GPU:

```
pip install jax[gpu]
```

Or, if you want to run JAX on a TPU:

```
pip install jax[tpu]
```

From there, you should be able to follow along with each tutorial.
